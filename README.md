# ExcelRTD
C# Visual Studio Tools for Office - Capture Excel Events for Analysis.

This project uses Excel Real Time Data (RTD) functions to retrieve stock market data. It hooks into the Worksheet_Update event and compares data points on individual stocks with pre-defined ranges and conditionally formats ranges when thresholds are crossed.
The project uses Object Oriented principles to expose a class that uses inheritance techniques to extend functionality.
I use NLog to log event data.
